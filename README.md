# FurRealEase – Backend 🐾

This is the backend of **FurRealEase**, a full-stack pet health manager app built as my final project during a web development bootcamp.

The backend handles all core logic and data operations, including authentication, routing, and database interactions. I built it independently using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## 🧪 What it does

-   JWT-based user authentication & route protection
-   RESTful API endpoints for managing pets, weight data, vaccinations, medications, reminders, notes and vet visits
-   MongoDB database with Mongoose schemas & validation
-   Secure route access and error handling
-   Modular, clean controller-based structure

## 🧠 What I'm proud of

-   I wrote the entire backend myself from scratch
-   Learned how to structure and protect REST APIs
-   Integrated authentication and authorization logic cleanly
-   Designed a flexible data structure for complex health data

## 🛠️ Technologies used

-   Node.js
-   Express.js
-   MongoDB & Mongoose
-   JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
-   dotenv, CORS, bcrypt, etc.
